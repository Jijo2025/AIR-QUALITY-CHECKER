Air Quality Index (AQI)
Overview
The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a standardized measurement system used to assess air pollution levels. It provides real-time data on air quality, helping individuals understand potential health impacts.
How It Works
- AQI values range from 0 to 500, categorized into different health risk levels.
- It considers key pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO₂, SO₂, and O₃.
- Color-coded indicators show pollution severity (e.g., green for good, red for hazardous).
Applications
- Used by governments to issue pollution warnings
- Helps individuals make informed decisions about outdoor activities
- Supports research and environmental monitoring
